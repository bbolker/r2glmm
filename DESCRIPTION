Description: This package contains functions to compute R squared for the
    linear and generalized linear mixed model (LMM and GLMM).
    The R squared measure from Edwards et.al (2008) using the Kenward Roger
    approach or the residual degrees of freedom is computed for the LMM
    and R^2_{sgv} is computed for GLMMs using
    Penalized Quasi Likelihood (PQL) Estimation.
