Description: This package contains functions to compute model R squared and
    semi-partial R squared for the linear and generalized linear mixed model
    (LMM and GLMM). The R squared measure from Edwards et.al (2008) is extended
    to the GLMM using penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation (see Jaeger
    et al. 2016). Three methods of computation are provided: (1) The Kenward-Roger
    approach, (2) The method introduced by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013), which
    was later extended by Johnson (2014), and (3) an approach using standardized
    generalized variance (SGV) to facilitate covariance model selection.
    Confidence limits for semi partial R squared and model R squared are computed
    for each of the methods listed.
