Description: This package contains functions to compute model R squared and
    semi-partial R squared for the linear and generalized linear mixed model
    (LMM and GLMM). The R squared measure from Edwards et.al (2008) is extended
    to the GLMM using penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation (see Jaeger
    et al. 2016). Three methods of computation are provided:
    (1) The Kenward-Roger approach*,
    (2) The method introduced by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013)**, and
    (3) an approach using standardized generalized variance (SGV)
    that can be used for both mean model and covariance model selection.
    Confidence limits for semi partial R squared and model R squared are
    computed for each of the methods listed.
    Instructions for installation:
    After installing the devtools package, run this code in the console:
    devtools::install_github('bcjaeger/r2glmm')
    *Due to some inconsistency between the pbkrtest package and the glmmPQL
    function, the Kenward-Roger approach in the r2glmm package is limited to
    the LMM.
    **The r2glmm package only computes marginal R squared for the LMM and
    does not generalize the statistic to the GLMM; however, confidence limits
    may be computed for this marginal R squared in the LMM using this package
