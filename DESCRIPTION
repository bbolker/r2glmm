Description: This package contains functions to compute R squared for the
    linear and generalized linear mixed model (LMM and GLMM).
    The R squared measure from Edwards et.al (2008) is extended to the GLMM
    using penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation. Three methods of
    computation are provided: (1) The Kenward-Roger approach, (2) The method
    introduced by Nakagawa and Schielzeth, which was later extended by Johnson,
    and (3) an approach using standardized generalized variance (SGV) to
    facilitate covariance model selection. Semi-partial R squared
    for individual predictors are provided for each of the methods listed.
