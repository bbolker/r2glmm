Description: The model R squared and semi-partial R squared for the linear and
    generalized linear mixed model (LMM and GLMM) are computed with confidence
    limits. The R squared measure from Edwards et.al (2008) <DOI:10.1002/sim.3429>
    is extended to the GLMM using penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) estimation
    (see Jaeger et al. 2016 <DOI:10.1080/02664763.2016.1193725>). Three methods
    of computation are provided and described as follows. (1) The
    Kenward-Roger approach; due to some inconsistencies between the 'pbkrtest'
    package and the 'glmmPQL' function, the Kenward-Roger approach in the
    'r2glmm' package is limited to the LMM. (2) The method introduced
    by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013) <DOI:10.1111/j.2041-210x.2012.00261.x>
    and later extended by Johnson (2014) <DOI:10.1111/2041-210X.12225>.
    The 'r2glmm' package only computes marginal R squared for the LMM and does
    not generalize the statistic to the GLMM; however, confidence limits and
    semi-partial R squared for fixed effects are useful additions. (3) Lastly, an
    approach using standardized generalized variance (SGV) can be used for
    covariance model selection.
