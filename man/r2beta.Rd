\usage{
r2beta(model, partial = T, method = "sgv")
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a fitted mermod, lme, or glmmPQL model.}

\item{partial}{if TRUE, semi-partial R squared are calculated for each
fixed effect in the mixed model.}

\item{method}{Specifies the method of computation for R squared beta:
if \code{method} = 'sgv' then the standardized generalized variance
approach is applied.
if \code{method} = 'kr', then the Kenward Roger approach is applied.
This option is only available for \code{\link{lme}} models.
if \code{method} = 'nsj',then the Nakagawa and Schielzeth approach
is applied. This option is available for
\code{\link{lmer}} and \code{\link{lme}} objects.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the model F statistic, numerator
  and denominator degrees of freedom, and R squared statistic. If
  partial = TRUE, then the dataframe also contains partial
  R squared statistics for all fixed effects in the model
}
\description{
Computes coefficient of determination (R squared) from
edwards et al., 2008. Currently implemented for linear mixed models with
\code{\link{lmer}} and \code{\link{lme}} objects. For
generalized linear mixed models, \code{\link{glmmPQL}} objects
must be used with \code{ddf} = 'res'.
