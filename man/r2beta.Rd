\title{Computes coefficient of determination (r squared) from edwards et al., 2008.}
\usage{
r2beta(model, data = NULL, partial = F, ddf = "res", NS.adj = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a fitted lmerMod object}

\item{data}{the data used for the fitted model.}

\item{partial}{if TRUE, semi-partial R squared are calculated for each
fixed effect in the mixed model.}

\item{ddf}{Approximation method for the denominator degrees of freedom
if ddf = 'res' then residual degrees of freedom are used
if ddf = 'kr', then the Kenward Roger approach is applied.}

\item{NS.adj}{if TRUE, the denominator degrees of freedom are
adjusted to replicate the R squared proposed by Nakagawa and Schielzeth.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the model F statistic, numerator
  and denominator degrees of freedom, and R^2 statistic. If
  partial = TRUE, then the dataframe also contains partial
  R^2 statistics for all fixed effects in the model
